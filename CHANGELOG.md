  To help members of the community, it's a good idea to maintain a
  changelog to help people understand changes over time in your
  project.
  
  Better yet, have CI help you maintain the changelog. Check out the
  atomic_cache project for an example.
  https://github.com/Ibotta/atomic_cache/blob/416680ba88916129a4f8eecb127ade458a9714b8/ci-helpers/gem_helper#L88-L103
